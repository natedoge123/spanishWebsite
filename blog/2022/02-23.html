      <h1>A Familiar Feeling</h1>
      <h3>February 23rd, 2022</h3>
      <p>I would first like to say that I hate the spelling of February, it is dumb and I hate it. And not that anyone reads this that I don't know but whoops for not writing anything even though I said I would try to do that more. Oh well, who cares.</p>
      <p>Do you trust the feelings your brain gives you in certain situation? Or do you sometimes fight it because you want it to be wrong?</p>
      <p>I work as an industrial controls engineer. All day (some days) I spend my time making machines take specific inputs and then do something as an ouput, and I am 100% in control of those output actions. Until I come home and have time to think about life and then I am no longer in control of my machine (me). I, like everyone else, see the world from my perspective and mine alone. Sometimes those inputs in my life tell my unconscious brain one thing and that thing makes it to the surface where my active brain can think about what the quiet part just thought up. But the quiet part doesn't say what I want it to some of the time. When this happens do you go with your gut feeling or do you go with your active brain in hopes that your gut is wrong and the thing you probably want to happen will happen?</p>
      <p>This situation IMO pretty well describes my alone time. My gut feeling brain is telling me that sensors point to one answer that has been more or less "proven" in the past, but the active brain wants the opposite. There are factors to this story that are out of my control and there is no way to get an exact answer without affecting the outcome of the current situation. For now I will continue to let them argue as they have been for a few days and soon I will have to make a decision on who to listen to, or maybe I will just affect the situation and find the answer I need to make the decision.</p>
      <p>This is all very vague for no particular reason other than I want it to be. It might be applicable to more situations in life than the current one so maybe I'll come back and revisit this idea later.</p>
      <p>Thanks for reading this. There are probably some typos that I am not going to fix, who cares, its the internet.</p>
