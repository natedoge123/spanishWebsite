      <h1>Reading is Freaking Hard</h1>
      <h3>March 16th, 2022</h3>
      <p>It's freaking hard to read a book every two weeks for entire year and I am saying this and it is only march. Some books are so long that even reading. Any way here is a list of books I have read so far this year.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Industrial Society and Its Future</li>
        <li>Dune Messiah</li>
        <li>The Quite Americans</li>
        <li>Surely You're Joking, My. Feyman</li>
        <li>The Beginning of Infinity (currently working on this one)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Besides books I freaking hate the feeling of having a phone on you all the time. They are so freaking addicting. Phones and the apps they run are designed so specifically you make you want to use them more and more all the way down to the damn colors they use. It freaking stinks. I just want to use that thing as a tool to communicate and as a wallet of sorts. But they just suck you in with notification and other dumb things that make your little brain just want to use it more. Unfortunately it is the world we currently live in, and we have to carry them around to be part of society, very sad.</p>
      <p>I thought of this really funny joke this vary morning when I got to work and was sitting at my desk before anyone else got there. The joke "how about a homophobic physicst who is scared to say Richard Feynman's name".</p>
      <p>That is it, thanks for reading. I'm sure I made some spelling mistakes and forgot some words as I usually do when I write shit down.</p>
